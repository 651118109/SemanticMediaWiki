# Semantic MediaWiki 2.3

This is not a release yet.


## New features

### SPARQLStore

Several improvements (including functional as well as performance related) have been made available to bring the `SPARQLStore` on par with the `SQLStore` supported feature set.

Added the following options (It is assumed that the selected TDB back-end supports SPARQL 1.1 otherwise the `$GLOBALS['smwgSparqlQFeatures']` has to be set to `SMW_SPARQL_QF_NONE`) to:
* #1001 `SMW_SPARQL_QF_REDI` to enable property/value redirects support in queries (),
* #1003 `SMW_SPARQL_QF_SUBP` to enable subproperty hierarchy support for the `SPARQLStore`
* #1012 `SMW_SPARQL_QF_SUBC` to enable subcategory hierarchy support for the `SPARQLStore`
* #1110 Extended `TurtleTriplesBuilder` to split larger turtle sets into chunks
* #1152 Added preference for use of canonical identifiers to support language agnostic category/property statements, (use `$GLOBALS['smwgExportBCNonCanonicalFormUse'] = true` to keep backwards compatibility until 3.x)
* #1158 Added basic support for `_geo` queries to the `SPARQLStore`
* #1159 Added limitation of the `aux` property usage in the Exporter (use `$GLOBALS['smwgExportBCAuxiliaryUse'] = true;` to keep backwards compatibility until 3.x)

### Property/Subject deletion

* #1100 introduced a deletion marker on entities that got deleted, making those entities no longer available to queries or special page display.
* #1127 Added `--shallow-update` to `rebuildData`, to only parse those entities that have a different last modified timestamp compared to that of the last revision. This enables to run `rebuildData` updates on deleted, redirects, and other out of sync entities.
* Solved #701 where an unconditional namespace query `[[Help:+]]` would display deleted subjects (in case those subjects were deleted)
* #1105 Added filter to mark deleted redirect targets with `SMW_SQL3_SMWDELETEIW`
* #1112 Added filter to mark unused/oudated subobjects with `SMW_SQL3_SMWDELETEIW`
* #1151 Added removal of unmatched "ghost" pages in the ID_TABLE

## Enhancements

* #1042 Extended `rebuildData.php` to inform about the estimated % progress
* #1047 Extended context help displayed on `Special:Types` and subsequent type pages
* #1049 Added resource targets to allow MobileFrontend to load SMW related modules
* #1053 Added a `CSS` rule to visually distinguish a "normal" from a subobject link
* #1063 Added `$GLOBALS['smwgValueLookupCacheType']` to improve DB lookup performance though the use of a responsive cache layer (such as `redis`) and buffer repeated requests either from the API or page view to the back-end.
* #1066, #1075 Extended `InTextAnnotationParser` to correctly handle `::` or `:::` and allow for proper processing of annotations such as `[[DOI::10.1002/123::abc]]` or `[[Foo:::123]]`
* #1097 Predefined property aliases are redirected to the base property
* #1107 #set to indicate the `last-element` in a template
* #1106 rebuildData / Add `--skip-properties` / remove marked for deletion first
* #1129 Extended `~*` search pattern for `_ema` and `_tel` to allow for searches like `[[Has telephone number::~*0123*]]` and `[[Has email::~*123.org]]`
* #1147 Added `columns=0` to be interpret as responsive column setting in the `format=category` printer (auto-column feature)
* #1171 Extended `format=debug` to output the query EXPLAIN report that is generated by the SQL engine (those which support this feature) to allow for a better comprehesion about the overall `#ask` execution
* #1172 Added `@category` as fixed parameter to `#subobject`
* #1178 Added ~/!~ expression support for the `_dat` type

## Experimental features

These features are disabled by default and can be turned on using configuration. Additional logging
happens for these features until they mature from being an experimental feature in a future release.

* #1035, #1063 Added `CachedValueLookupStore` as post-cached layer to improve DB read access (`$GLOBALS['smwgValueLookupCacheType']`, $GLOBALS['smwgValueLookupCacheLifetime'])
* #1116 Added $GLOBALS['smwgValueLookupFeatures'] setting to fain grain the cache access level, default is set to `SMW_VL_SD | SMW_VL_PL | SMW_VL_PV | SMW_VL_PS;`
* #1117 Added `EmbeddedQueryDependencyLinksStore` to track query dependencies and update altered queries using `ParserCachePurgeJob` for when `$GLOBALS['smwgEnabledQueryDependencyLinksStore']` is enabled
* #1135 Added `$GLOBALS['smwgPropertyDependencyDetectionBlacklist']` to exclude properties from dependency detection
* #1141 Added detection of property and category hierarchy dependency in `EmbeddedQueryDependencyLinksStore`
